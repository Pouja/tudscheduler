# TUD Scheduler
Helps you to orginize/select/overview your TU Delft Master courses

# Courses
The only courses that I scraped are from master CS year 2015/2016 from TU Delft.  
I will change the way how the data of the courses are loaded and stored in such a way that it would be easier to add another year/study.

# Contributing
`gulp watch` to start browserify, watchify, babelify etc so you can live edit.  
Also, there are no tests, the only thing the code should pass is the eslint.
