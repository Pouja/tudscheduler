# TUD Scheduler
Helps you to orginize/select/overview your TU Delft Master courses and soon it will allow you to generate your ISP form. No more manual form submission.

# Courses
The courses are scraped from the tudelft study guide.
There is a TU Delft api, but that sucks in overal data structure (it is a real mess).

# Contributing
`gulp watch` to start browserify, watchify, babelify etc so you can live edit.  
Also, there are no tests, the only thing the code should pass is the lint.
