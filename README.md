# TUD Scheduler
Helps you to orginize/select/overview your TU Delft Master courses

# Courses
The only courses that I scraped are from master Computer Science year 2015/2016 from TU Delft.  
Just found out that there is an TU Delft api, who would have guess...  
I will see if I can integrate that in the website.

# Contributing
`gulp watch` to start browserify, watchify, babelify etc so you can live edit.  
Also, there are no tests, the only thing the code should pass is the eslint.

# Todo's
 - [ ] Make an export/import to/from csv so you can edit and continue on another computer, or so you can edit in excel
 - [ ] Try to integrate the TU Delft API
