# TUD Scheduler
Helps you to orginize/select/overview your TU Delft Master courses

# Courses
The only courses that I scraped are from master Computer Science year 2015/2016 from TU Delft.  
If you want your study here, please let me know, I will try to see if I can add it.

# Contributing
`gulp watch` to start browserify, watchify, babelify etc so you can live edit.  
Also, there are no tests, the only thing the code should pass is the eslint.

# Todo's
 - [] Make an export/import to/from csv so you can edit and continue on another computer, or so you can edit in excel
 - [] Ability to schedule for multiple years
 - [] Make it easier (code wise) to switch between years and or study
