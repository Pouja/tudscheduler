These criteria are published in the study guide and should be known to the student beforehand. (Use \"Thesis evaluation form\").The voting members of the thesis committee determine the final grade. The grade should reflect a weighted average of the four scores above, but need not to be an exact arithmetical mean. The final mark starts from 5 up to and 10. Marks ending in .5 may also be used.If the student shows excellence (is nominated for a 10) the chair of the thesis committee should consult the chair of the Board of Examiners, at least five working days in advance of the defense. The chair may advice to add an extra member to the thesis committee.The motivation for the grade at each of the four criteria as listed above is summarized on a form (Use: \"Thesis evaluation form\") and signed by the chairman of the thesis committee. The candidate is given a short account of the assessment, either in private or in front of the audience."

Such techniques are applied in order to protect information against errors which may occur during transmission or storage. The specific techniques under consideration in the course are the ones discussed in the lecture notes, which may be updated from year to year according to recent developments. The emphasis will be on the basic trade-offs between efficiency, reliability, and complexity. Unless explicitly indicated, the proofs of the results are not part of the course contents (the interested student may consult books from the bibliography). In the end, the student should be capable of making choices for suitable error correction coding techniques in the context of information transmission and storage applications. The student has to demonstrate to have understood the aforementioned techniques and trade-offs. This can be done in various ways.* \"Broad\": The student solves exercises in a closed-book written or oral exam. The level of these exercises is similar to the examples and exercises provided in the lecture notes. * \"Narrow, but in-depth\": In consultation with the lecturer, the student chooses a certain topic from the course, which is investigated in more detail, by writing either an essay (discussing a paper from the recent literature) or a computer program for a demo explaining the chosen topic (to be used by the lecturer in class room).",

The course emphasizes multidisciplinary work with attention to cure (societal and personal needs), culture (motivation and acceptation), concept (usability and technical realisation), and commercialisation (marketing plan and business realisation). During the first week, students are introduced to the thematic area by presentations on societal problems, trends, new technologies, and possible business opportunities. Here, the emphasis is on discussion, opin-ion making, and experiencing through observational practices and field tests. Students work in groups on a business cases and develop ICT applications (products or services) for a particular thematic area. They perform market studies, define user segments, analyse competitors, and develop their concepts into testable (lo-fi) prototypes. They perform user studies (focus groups) and further detail the technical concepts. At the end of the week they pitch their plan for a business panel.In the second week, students work towards a business plan (Product Operational Plan) and analyse all is-sues of relevance; markets, feasibility, usability, business life-cycles, operations and maintenance. They make a design/choice for a business pattern and platform, and a suitable revenue model, and analyse relevant issues, such as IPR, venture financing, etc.",

Such techniques are applied in order to protect information against errors which may occur during transmission or storage. The specific techniques under consideration in the course are the ones discussed in the lecture notes, which may be updated from year to year according to recent developments. The emphasis will be on the basic trade-offs between efficiency, reliability, and complexity. Unless explicitly indicated, the proofs of the results are not part of the course contents (the interested student may consult books from the bibliography). In the end, the student should be capable of making choices for suitable error correction coding techniques in the context of information transmission and storage applications. The student has to demonstrate to have understood the aforementioned techniques and trade-offs. This can be done in various ways.* \"Broad\": The student solves exercises in a closed-book written or oral exam. The level of these exercises is similar to the examples and exercises provided in the lecture notes. * \"Narrow, but in-depth\": In consultation with the lecturer, the student chooses a certain topic from the course, which is investigated in more detail, by writing either an essay (discussing a paper from the recent literature) or a computer program for a demo explaining the chosen topic (to be used by the lecturer in class room).",

The course emphasizes multidisciplinary work with attention to cure (societal and personal needs), culture (motivation and acceptation), concept (usability and technical realisation), and commercialisation (marketing plan and business realisation). During the first week, students are introduced to the thematic area by presentations on societal problems, trends, new technologies, and possible business opportunities. Here, the emphasis is on discussion, opin-ion making, and experiencing through observational practices and field tests. Students work in groups on a business cases and develop ICT applications (products or services) for a particular thematic area. They perform market studies, define user segments, analyse competitors, and develop their concepts into testable (lo-fi) prototypes. They perform user studies (focus groups) and further detail the technical concepts. At the end of the week they pitch their plan for a business panel.In the second week, students work towards a business plan (Product Operational Plan) and analyse all is-sues of relevance; markets, feasibility, usability, business life-cycles, operations and maintenance. They make a design/choice for a business pattern and platform, and a suitable revenue model, and analyse relevant issues, such as IPR, venture financing, etc.",

Students will design a (complex multi-actor) system related to Information Architecture applying specific SEPAM and/or CS perspectives on designing. Most projects will integrate technical, system and actor related aspects. This includes addressing technology aspects, system engineering, decision-making support, and process and institutional aspects of the design and implementation process. Students are free to come up with suggestions for their own case study. The final delivery of this course concerns a scientific report which should more or less have the same structure as an individual MSc thesis. In this sense, this design course is an excellent preparation (within a group assignment) for the writing of an individual MSc thesis.",
                "Study Goals": "On completion of this course, students will be able:- to choose suitable system design methods and tools, taking into account the substantive and process characteristics of the system and the multi-actor environment in a specific and realistic case in their domain;- to apply the chosen design methods and tools for this case;- to design a system taking into account technical domain, system engineering, decision-making, change process management and institutional aspects that are relevant for a certain case;- to develop knowledge and experience on the setup up and implementation of project teams.",
                "Education Method": "The design teams will consist of preferably 3 or 4 students from the same domain.

The course emphasizes multidisciplinary work with attention to cure (societal and personal needs), culture (motivation and acceptation), concept (usability and technical realisation), and commercialisation (marketing plan and business realisation). During the first week, students are introduced to the thematic area by presentations on societal problems, trends, new technologies, and possible business opportunities. Here, the emphasis is on discussion, opin-ion making, and experiencing through observational practices and field tests. Students work in groups on a business cases and develop ICT applications (products or services) for a particular thematic area. They perform market studies, define user segments, analyse competitors, and develop their concepts into testable (lo-fi) prototypes. They perform user studies (focus groups) and further detail the technical concepts. At the end of the week they pitch their plan for a business panel.In the second week, students work towards a business plan (Product Operational Plan) and analyse all is-sues of relevance; markets, feasibility, usability, business life-cycles, operations and maintenance. They make a design/choice for a business pattern and platform, and a suitable revenue model, and analyse relevant issues, such as IPR, venture financing, etc.",

The course emphasizes multidisciplinary work with attention to cure (societal and personal needs), culture (motivation and acceptation), concept (usability and technical realisation), and commercialisation (marketing plan and business realisation). During the first week, students are introduced to the thematic area by presentations on societal problems, trends, new technologies, and possible business opportunities. Here, the emphasis is on discussion, opin-ion making, and experiencing through observational practices and field tests. Students work in groups on a business cases and develop ICT applications (products or services) for a particular thematic area. They perform market studies, define user segments, analyse competitors, and develop their concepts into testable (lo-fi) prototypes. They perform user studies (focus groups) and further detail the technical concepts. At the end of the week they pitch their plan for a business panel.In the second week, students work towards a business plan (Product Operational Plan) and analyse all is-sues of relevance; markets, feasibility, usability, business life-cycles, operations and maintenance. They make a design/choice for a business pattern and platform, and a suitable revenue model, and analyse relevant issues, such as IPR, venture financing, etc.",
