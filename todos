* change the directory structure, there are now too many files in components
* change the structure of AllCourses.json, it should contain a list of all courses and a tree of ids on how the courses relate to each other
* add filter based on track/research group
* improve the user form
* add autofill based on track/research group
* change the error message: it now only shows in red what is wrong, but it should be a more readible list of things. For example:
 - You have 3 courses selected too many/few
